# About Me


---

I am a 17 year old high school student studying web and software development.
I have had an interest in computers since I was young so Iâ€™ve had a lot of time to
tinker with them and learn about them. I focused my efforts on learning about the
languages of web development, common frameworks and concepts used throughout Web Development.

I am based out of Athens GA, USA. I am currently looking for possible jobs and(or)
clients. After high school i plan to attend a 2 year technical college and get a
post secondary education in Web Development along with possibly acquiring other relating certifications.

This website is an open project i have shared with the community for all to see.
Not only is this for my community but companies and organizations that may have
an interest in my skillset and are looking into me.
