## *Deeper Waters*

*author: Brayden Downey*

*Date: April 6th 2023 or 04/06/23*


    When I was much younger, I had always dreamed of the 4 year college experience. Then into middle school,
I began to struggle with my education and communicating with my peers. Even with this setback i still applied
myself to the skills I was building to become a Web Developer.

    Once i started High School i began to find that I was in-fact very intelligent and good at the things i do,
The only issue was that I struggled to express myself. As the time went by, I now find myself at the end of my 
Junior year of High School, and with a small circle of friends and a few resources to reach out to, but I still
I need to expand my horizons. In that time i've also come to the conclusion that a 4-year college isn't my thing
and that a 2 year technical college is more my style. 

    I hope to be a story of success for others to look to. I've started my journey from the very bottom and i've come a long way,
but i'm not done yet. I still have people to meet, places to go, and things to do. I hope that as you follow me through my journey,
yours may begin as well.

## *Into the storm*

    I find myself in a position where major changes are underway. Change can be good and it can be bad.
Where I find myself is quite stressful, a challenge even... However, I accept the challenge.
Someone has to be the one to break the cycle, so I must ask, Why not me? I have staked everything upon
my own success, failure is not an option and it never has been. I refuse to be broken and I refuse to fall to the same
mistakes of my younger self. I will persevere and come out on top, even if all odds are against me.

    Many times in my journey I find myself struggling to keep going or make something happen.
This can and will happen within your journey as well.the best words of advice i can tell you...
Take a break, Go for a walk, go to bed.When you keep hitting a wall, the best thing to do is to stop hitting the wall.
Instead, you're better off taking a break and coming back mentally refreshed to look at the problem or problems
from a clear state of mind. coding is a kind of problem solving and it requires critical thinking.
when you're exhausted your brain isn't working as sharply as it could be.by taking that break 
you give your mind and yourself time to zero back in and find a way to fix it, you may even find a
better way to do it if you take another break and look back at it again.

I hope that anyone who follows my story, whether you're just watching or on a journey of your own,
The one thing I hope you take from me is to never let hardship or fear keep you from your dreams.

You are never defeated until you say it yourself, only you can write your story.
Write a story that is worthy of being told eons from now.
