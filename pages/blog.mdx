# *Deeper Waters*

*author: Brayden Downey*

When I was much younger, I had always dreamed of the 4 year college experience. Then into middle school,
I began to struggle with my education and communicating with my peers. Even with this setback i still applied
myself to the skills i was building to become a Web Developer.
    Once i started High School i began to find that I was in-fact very intelligent and good at the things i do,
the only issue was that I struggled to express myself. As the time went by, I now find myself at the end of my 
Junior year of High School, and with a small circle of friends and a few resources to reach out to, but I still
need to expand my horizons. In that time ive also come to the conclusion that a 4-year college isnt my thing
and that a 2 year technical college is more my style. I hape to be a story of success for others to look to.
I've started my journey from the very bottom and ive come a long way, but im not done yet.
I still have people to meet, places to go, and things to do. I hope that as you follow me through my journey,
yours may begin as well.
