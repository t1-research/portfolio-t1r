# My Mission

*Stop Project Willow. Save The Arctic*

The Willow Project is a massive and decadeslong oil drilling venture
on Alaska's North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned
by the federal government. The area where the project is planned holds
up to 600 million barrels of oil.
