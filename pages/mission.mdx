*Stop Project Willow. Save The Arctic*

on Alaska's North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is owned
by the federal government. The area where the project is planned holds
up to 600 million barrels of oil.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Willow Project within itself is what scientists would call, *a carbon bomb.* however the media and other promotional agencies for the project
wont tell you that.
